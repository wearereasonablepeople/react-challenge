# What is required to complete the challenge

You are required to create a React App with an image gallery that interfaces with the Flickr API.
The application should be a single page that shows all images for a specific searched term.

# Business Requirements

We are looking for all of the requirements to be submitted. This is your chance to impress us, feel free to add any additional functionality or design.

## Features

### Search

  * User should be able to search for a term like "dog" or "cat" in a search field.

### Pre defined suggestions

  * Underneath the search box there should be 4 pre defined terms that will immediately perform a search after being clicked.
